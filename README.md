This is a **sandboxed simulation** of the OpenAI vs Hugging Face incident (July 2026), showing how an AI agent chains zero‑days.

## Quick Commands
- `make install` – install dependencies  
- `make run-agent` – watch the AI reason  
- `make run-server` – start the mock vulnerable Flask server  
- `make run-payload` – fire the simulated exploit  

See [docs/attack_flow.md](docs/attack_flow.md) for the technical walkthrough.
